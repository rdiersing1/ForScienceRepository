## About

This is the typical infinte runner game with a slight twist!

Monsters run at you and you only have a limited ammount of 

ammo to shoot at them. Eventually there will be more monsters

than ammo, in which case you will have to use your alternate

wepon! This wepon teleports monsters into the future so you 

can worry about them once you have gotten more ammo
